## Introduction
### Our Task 

We are a new team within an investment firm looking to enter the CryptoCurrency space with a passively managed algorithmic trading package that performs better than the S&P for our clients. Due to limited resources management has tasked our team with building & testing a Time Series & Neutral Network model in order to predict future performance. Then evaluate our models and draw general conclusions based on our performance. 

For this Analysis we will need to answer: 
1. Identify commonly traded Crypto currencies with reliable data   
2. Create an Recurring Neural Network in order to gain a signal to trade on
3. Create a Regression Anlysis to in order to gain a signal to trade on
4. Cominde the signals from step 2 & 3 in order to UPDATE
